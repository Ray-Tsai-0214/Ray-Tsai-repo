      "## Biography\n",
      "I am Ray Tsai, from the Department of Electrophysics at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. My university life has been marked not only by academic pursuits but also by the exploration of dreams and aspirations for the future. Academically, I have consistently ranked in the top 10% of my class (current GPA: 4.07), driven by a thirst for knowledge and a vision for the future impact of technology. As the Public Relations Officer of the Department of Electrophysics, I have had the opportunity to connect with many distinguished alumni, organizing seminars, corporate visits, and interviews. These experiences and the cultural insights gained have strengthened my resolve to contribute to the semiconductor industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leadership experiences have been growth opportunities for me, from being the captain of my high school basketball team to organizing freshman orientations in university. Each leadership role has taught me how to guide a team towards a goal, remain calm under pressure, and achieve consensus through effective communication. These experiences have honed my leadership skills and instilled in me a sense of responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI technology and natural language processing are fields I have delved into beyond my coursework. I have had the honor of being a teaching assistant for Professor Su-Yen Chen at Tsinghua University, focusing on the latest AI trends and promoting National Science Council projects. Additionally, I have participated in numerous AI competitions with corporate teams, winning several awards. These experiences not only demonstrate my capabilities but also fill me with anticipation for the future of AI. In Professor Po-Tsang Huang's lab at the International College of Semiconductor Technology, I have deeply explored hardware languages and IC design, fueling my passion for the semiconductor industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my leisure time, I enjoy playing basketball and golf, activities that keep me physically fit and challenge me to push my limits. Through sports, I have learned the importance of teamwork and the value of persistence and effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ability to face challenges and solve problems is the most significant skill I have developed over the years. Whether organizing large-scale events or finding innovative solutions in competitions, I approach each challenge with calm analysis and flexible response. These experiences have not only boosted my confidence but also honed my adaptability.\n",
